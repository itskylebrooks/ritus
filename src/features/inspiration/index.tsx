						<p className="mt-4 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Ritus isn’t about control. It’s about rhythm — the daily choices that makes you better. This page gathers small insights and examples to help you understand habits, build them with intention, and replace what holds you back.</p>

						<h2 className="text-lg font-medium">How habits really form</h2>
						<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">A habit isn’t a rule you follow — it’s a vote for the person you want to become. Consistency matters more than intensity: five minutes done every day beats an hour done once a week. Most habits fail because people expect motivation to last forever. But discipline isn’t about feeling ready — it’s about making action easier than resistance.</p>

					{/* Why breaking habits */}
					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-medium">Why breaking habits feels harder</h2>
						<p className="mt-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">Bad habits often solve a real need — stress, comfort, boredom. That’s why willpower alone rarely works. To stop something, you have to replace it with something better. “Don’t scroll” becomes “go for a walk.” “Don’t drink” becomes “call a friend.” Every habit you break must make space for something gentler to take its place.</p>

					{/* How to start new habits */}
					<section>
						<h2 className="text-lg font-medium">How to start new habits</h2>
						<ul className="mt-2 space-y-2 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">
							<li>Start embarrassingly small. Do less than you think you should — consistency first, expansion later.</li>
							<li>Pair new with existing. Attach a habit to a trigger (“after coffee, I’ll stretch”).</li>
							<li>Forgive breaks. Missing one day doesn’t matter. Missing twice does.</li>
							<li>Track to remember, not to punish. The goal is awareness, not perfection.</li>
